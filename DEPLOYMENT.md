## How to Set Environment Variables on Vercel

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with the appropriate value
5. Redeploy your project

## Current Setup

- **Production**: Uses Supabase for data storage (contact form, newsletter)
- **Sessions**: Memory-based in production (SQLite sessions don't work on Vercel)

## Data Storage

- **Contact Form Submissions**: Stored in Supabase table `KATcontactUSonly`
- **Newsletter Subscriptions**: Stored in Supabase table `KATnewsletter`
- **Users/Posts**: Currently SQLite only (development mode)

## Troubleshooting

If you see a 500 error:
1. Check that all required environment variables are set
2. Verify your Supabase credentials are correct
3. Check Vercel function logs for specific error messages

## Next Steps

To fully migrate to Supabase:
1. Create user and post tables in Supabase
2. Update authentication to use Supabase Auth
3. Migrate existing SQLite data to Supabase
