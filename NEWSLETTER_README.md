## Troubleshooting

### PDF Generation Issues

If PDF generation fails:

   npm install puppeteer
   ```

2. **Memory issues**: The system uses headless Chrome, which requires some memory

3. **Font issues**: The system uses web-safe fonts for compatibility

### Email Sending Issues

If emails aren't sending:

1. **Check email credentials**:
   - Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` are set
   - For Gmail, ensure you're using an App Password

2. **Check email limits**:
   - Gmail has daily sending limits
   - Consider using a service like SendGrid for large lists

3. **Check spam filters**:
   - Some emails might go to spam
   - Consider using a professional email service

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Uses sample data and local file generation
- **Production**: Uses real subscriber data from Supabase

## Security

- Only admin users can access newsletter management
- Email credentials are stored as environment variables
- Subscriber data is protected by authentication

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Scheduled sending** - Send newsletters at specific times
2. **A/B testing** - Test different newsletter versions
3. **Analytics** - Track open rates and click-through rates
4. **Templates** - Multiple newsletter templates
5. **Segmentation** - Send to specific subscriber groups
