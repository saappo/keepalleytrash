Dear Council Member [NAME],

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the City of Dallas's proposed changes to alley trash collection services. As a resident of [YOUR DISTRICT], I am deeply concerned about the impact these changes will have on our neighborhood and community.

Key Concerns:
• The transition from alley to curbside collection will negatively impact neighborhood aesthetics and property values
• Many residents, especially elderly and disabled individuals, will face significant challenges with curbside collection
• Our neighborhood was specifically designed for alley collection service
• The proposed changes will create safety hazards and reduce the walkability of our community

I urge you to:
1. Oppose the elimination of alley collection services
2. Support maintaining the current alley collection system
3. Consider alternative solutions that preserve neighborhood character while addressing operational concerns

Please represent the interests of your constituents and oppose these changes that will harm our community's quality of life.

Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter.

Sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]
