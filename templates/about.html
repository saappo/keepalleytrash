                            Keep Alley Trash is a community-driven platform created by neighbors who understand the importance 
                            of maintaining clean and safe neighborhoods. We believe that strong communities start with engaged 
                            residents who work together to preserve the services that make our city great.

                            When the City of Dallas announced plans to end alley trash collection for over 30,000 customers, 
                            we knew we had to act. This platform serves as a hub for neighbors to coordinate cleanup efforts, 
                            share information, and build stronger connections within our communities.
                        </p>
